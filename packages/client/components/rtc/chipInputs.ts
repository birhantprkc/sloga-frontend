/**
 * The encryption chip's INPUT ASSEMBLY — the derivation that used to sit
 * inline in `state.tsx` between reading its signals and calling `chipState`.
 *
 * 🔴 Why this module exists, and it is not tidiness. Three consecutive
 * `media-e2ee-reviewer` rounds found the SAME defect one line further down the
 * object literal this replaces:
 *
 *   round 3  the witness signal's initial value could be flipped to available
 *   round 4  ...and when that was pinned, the chip's READ of the signal could
 *            be replaced by an available literal instead
 *   round 5  ...and when that was pinned, EIGHT more one-line edits in the
 *            same literal each turned an honest amber or red into green
 *
 * Round 5 drove the real `chipState` for each and measured them. The worst is
 * `rosterVerified: []` — `[].every(v => v)` is `true`, so emptying that one
 * read promotes `e2ee_unverified` to `e2ee`, manufacturing a VERIFIED lock
 * over unverified participants. Every one of those edits kept the whole suite
 * green, because `state.tsx` imports Solid, LiveKit and the Tauri bridge, so
 * `node --test` cannot load it: no spec, and no mutation, has ever reached it.
 *
 * The gate answered each round with another source-text assertion, and round 5
 * defeated all of them at once by commenting the required line out and putting
 * the fake one underneath. That is why this is a module and not a seventh
 * grep: source text cannot see a dead guard, and enumerating instances of an
 * unbounded class is not converging.
 *
 * 🔴 What this does NOT close, stated plainly so nobody reads more into it.
 * `state.tsx` still binds the accessors, and a lying binding — `rosterVerified:
 * () => []` — is still unreachable by any spec. What changes is the size of
 * that surface: it goes from 45 lines of derivation plus 14 fakeable fields
 * down to 14 one-line bindings with nothing computed among them, and taking
 * accessors rather than values means faking one means writing a function
 * instead of typing a literal. The derivation itself — the screen-leg
 * exclusion, the FE-2 publication filter, the observed map, the local
 * declaration, the resecuring disjunction — is now spec'd and mutated here.

 *   of our devices' legs is a genuine remote publisher that we DO observe.
 *
 *   Media-e2ee final audit F7, and the reviewer's ruling on it. This
 *   exclusion was justified by two claims, and neither holds:
 *
 *   - "LiveKit never reports a status for the leg" is false. The pinned
 *     source (livekit-client 2.15.13 `src/e2ee/E2eeManager.ts` ~:221-236)
 *     sets a remote participant's status from `trackInfo.encryption !==
 *     NONE` on `TrackPublished` and on every `ConnectionStateChanged
 *     (Connected)`, subscribed or not, and the worker's `enable` reply emits
 *     it for any remote identity (~:173-180).
 *   - "No decode witness can vouch for it" is not a reason either. The
 *     witness never vouches for anyone; it can only contradict a green.
 *
 *   The ruling KEEPS the exclusion for now, for one reason only: removing it
 *   changes what the sharer's own phone shows. Before it goes, measure on a
 *   live Android leg whether this webview sees a status for its own leg
 *   within the admit grace. If it does, the leg is judged like any other
 *   publisher. If it does not, including it would hold that phone amber.
 * - FE-2: participants with no published track never report a status at all.
