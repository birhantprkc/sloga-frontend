/**
 * One tick of the voice-activity gate.
 *
 * Pure so the two ways this gate can talk over its user are pinned by a spec
 * instead of by a live call:
 *
 * 1. **The user's own mute outranks voice activity.** The gate analyzes its
 *    OWN `getUserMedia` stream, which is a different capture from the one the
 *    call publishes — `setMicrophoneEnabled(false)` mutes the published track
 *    and leaves the gate's stream running at full level. Without `userMuted`
 *    here, a muted user who started talking was unmuted about 50 ms later and
 *    broadcast to the call while the button still read "muted" (reported
 *    2026-09-10; muting on the user's audio interface DID hold, because that
 *    silences the gate's stream as well, which is what identified this).
 *
 * 2. **The streak is counted in frames, not ticks.** The caller's timer can
 *    be stretched by a throttled window, and `VAD_OPEN_FRAMES` is expressed
 *    in 60 fps frames.
 *
 * The closing half stays with the caller: it owns the silence countdown, and
 * a `speaking: false` tick only means the countdown may run, never that the
 * microphone is cut this instant.
