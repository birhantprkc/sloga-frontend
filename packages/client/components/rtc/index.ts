// `screenAudioNative.ts` above — native WASAPI process-loopback in the Tauri
// shell versus PipeWire through the Electron shell — and the two modules own
// several of the same export names for it. Re-exporting either one bare would
// make the barrel answer one module's question with the other module's
// implementation, and on Windows that routes the caller into an Electron
// surface that does not exist there. Same aliases `state.tsx` uses.
