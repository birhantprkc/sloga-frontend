// Unit spec for the moderator-move client gate (AFK plan, 2026-09-22).
//   node --test --conditions=browser components/rtc/movePolicy.test.ts
//
// Focus: which SESSION acts on a `UserMoveVoiceChannel` event. The backend
// sends it privately to the moved user and `EventV1::private` reaches every
// session that user has, off-call devices included, so half the interesting
// cases are "a device that should stay put was told about a move". The other
// half is the mirror image and is easy to get wrong in the opposite
// direction: the eviction can still reach the client ahead of the event, so
// the real target is no longer CONNECTED when the move lands and a naive gate
// ignores it — silently leaving the member in no call at all. Addressing
// therefore asks which session WAS in `from`, recently, and both halves are
// pinned below.
//
// 🔴 The device the token was minted for is the only unforgeable signal here,
// and it is ABSENT on most seats. An identity is device-qualified only when
// the client asked for one: `create_token` falls back to the bare `user.id`
// otherwise, and `#connectAttempt` asks only when `callEncryptionCapable`
// holds. Web, the Electron/Linux shell and every unenrolled user therefore
// join bare, and the event they receive carries no device at all. So the
// spec below is organized around three populations, not two: verified
// sessions, sessions verified to be someone ELSE's, and sessions that cannot
// be verified either way. The third is the largest and gets its own outcome —
// `fail-loud` / `unverified-session` — because both silent answers available
// to it are wrong: ignoring strands the real target in no call, and moving
// lets an idle seat that was merely force-disconnected by a handoff publish a
// microphone into a room nobody is sitting at.
//
// 🔴 The per-connection NONCE is the fourth dimension, and the addressing
// label for bare seats. The event carries the moved connection's nonce,
// which the server read from the `CONN_NONCE_ATTRIBUTE` token attribute at
// move time. The session holds its own live nonce and the one it snapshotted
// with its drop marker. When both sides of a clause carry one, the nonce
// REPLACES the device test at every step. When either side lacks one, the
// ladder must answer exactly as it did before the nonce existed, and that is
// pinned against a fingerprint of the old ladder's answers, captured at
// commit 66c575a8, not just asserted case by case. Every pre-existing case
// below runs with all three nonce fields `undefined` (see `decide`), so each
// one is also a row of that truth table.
//
// 🔴 S-a adds a fifth dimension: the nonce this session is DIALING
// (`pendingConnNonce`) and the one its CONNECTED rejoin REPLACED
// (`replacedConnNonce`, aged by `replacedLeftAt`). They are read only when
// the gate is active and the nonces differ, and they can only turn a
// `moved-elsewhere` into an addressed answer. That is pinned three ways: a
// fingerprint of the whole nonce sweep captured from the ladder at commit
// 16734940, before S-a, which the new ladder must reproduce with the three
// fields absent; a G1 sweep in which no S-a value moves an inactive-gate
// answer; and a "widening only" sweep over every S-a shape in which every
// changed answer was `moved-elsewhere` and is traced to the field that
// matched.
//
// 🔴 There are TWO windows and the spec pins both edges of each. Inside
// `MOVE_VERIFIED_WINDOW_MS` a marker can still buy a move; between there and
// `MOVE_NOTICE_WINDOW_MS` it buys only a `stale-notice` toast, because the
// token is past relying on but the session's own rejoin loop is still
// dialling the OLD channel back and would reverse the moderator in silence;
// past the outer
// bound the marker means nothing and the session goes quiet like any other
// bystander.
//
// The precedence tests matter more than the branch tests: addressing is
// decided before feasibility, so an idle phone that also cannot resolve the
// destination must stay SILENT rather than raise an error about a call it is
// not in. The time constants are pinned against the token's real TTL — as a
// THREE-term sum, because the window alone is measured from the client's own
// drop clock and not from the mint, and `MOVE_TOKEN_SKEW_ALLOWANCE_MS` is the
// reservation for the difference.
//
// 🔴 Every assertion calls `moveDecision`. Nothing here re-types the rule it
// is checking — a spec that restates its subject passes a revert.
