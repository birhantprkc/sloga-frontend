/**
 * The worker that hosts Whisper. Everything expensive happens here.
 *
 * ## Why inference must not run on the main thread
 *
 * ONNX Runtime here is SINGLE-THREADED wasm (no COOP/COEP → no
 * SharedArrayBuffer), and every decode step is a synchronous wasm call. On a
 * machine slower than realtime, running that in the page blocks the UI for
 * seconds per utterance, back to back — reported from the field on 2026-08-10
 * as "the app freezes, then crashes and reopens" (the webview renderer dying
 * under sustained saturation). The dev boxes this shipped from run
 * whisper-tiny faster than realtime, so no solo test ever showed it. A worker
 * turns "machine too slow" into "transcript lags", which is the correct
 * failure, and a worker crash takes the transcription instead of the app.
 *
 * ## Everything is same-origin, deliberately
 *
 * transformers.js fetches models from huggingface.co by default, and
 * onnxruntime-web separately fetches its own `.wasm` runtime from a jsDelivr
 * CDN. Both are third-party requests made while a private call is in progress,
 * and the second one is also blocked outright by the desktop shell's CSP (see
 * `voiceAudioPipeline.ts`). Both are pointed at our own origin below, and a
 * transcription session should make no cross-origin request at all — that is a
 * verifiable property, and it is meant to be verified. Relative URLs resolve
 * against this worker's own script origin, so the paths mean the same thing
 * they meant on the main thread.
 *
 * ## The version pin is load-bearing — do not casually bump it
 *
 * Verified working end to end in Chrome 2026-07-31: model fetched from our own
 * origin, session created, live speech transcribed and attributed, on
 * `@huggingface/transformers` 3.8.1 with onnxruntime-web 1.22.
 *
 * **4.x does not work here.** With 4.2.0 (onnxruntime-web 1.26.0-dev) session
 * creation dies in an ORT graph-optimisation pass — `qdq_actions.cc:137
 * TransposeDQWeightsForMatMulNBits Missing required scale`. That was
 * reproduced across q8, int8, uint8 AND unquantised fp32 weights, and with the
 * optimiser disabled, basic, and on the WebGPU provider: nine combinations,
 * one identical error. The same files load fine under onnxruntime-node, so it
 * is the web runtime rather than the model.
 *
 * **Two traps cost hours here, and will again.**
 *
 * 1. Vite pre-bundles dependencies. After changing the transformers version,
 *    the page keeps being served the OLD pre-bundle until vite re-optimises on
 *    the next server start — so 3.8.1 appeared to fail with a spurious `both
 *    async and sync fetching of the wasm failed` while the page was in fact
 *    still running 4.2.0. **Restart the dev server after touching this
 *    dependency, and confirm "Re-optimizing dependencies" in its output.**
 * 2. The vendored ORT runtime under {@link ORT_WASM_BASE} must come from the
 *    EXACT version resolved here. The pnpm store keeps old copies, so a bare
 *    `find` for an onnxruntime-web dist happily returns the wrong one.
