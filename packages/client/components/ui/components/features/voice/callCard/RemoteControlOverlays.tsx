                The capture `Surface` is `zIndex: 20` over the whole tile so
                that a remote click cannot hit Sloga's own chrome — every
                overlay it covers used to be a dead zone, and the theater one
                actively EXITED theater mode. The unhandled consequence was
                the mirror image: once control starts the controller is
                frozen at whatever size they had, with the expand button
                silently unresponsive and nothing saying why.

                🔴 The fix must NOT be to lower that z-index; it would put
                every dead zone back. This panel is portalled to `#floating`
                at `zIndex: 200`, outside the call card's stacking context
                entirely, so a click here never traverses the tile — which is
                the "bind tile sizing to a controller-side action" direction
                rather than the "exempt an in-tile affordance" one.

                Both actions are exactly what the call card's own two buttons
                do, in the order a user would press them, so this introduces
                no state the app could not already reach. `toggleFullscreen
                (false)` drops immersive on its way out, so one call restores
                both. Message ids are reused from those buttons deliberately:
                `lingui extract` does not run in this tree. */}
