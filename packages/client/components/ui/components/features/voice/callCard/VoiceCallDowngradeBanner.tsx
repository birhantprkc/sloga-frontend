/**
 * The §3.4 whole-call downgrade banner (slice 6.5). Blocking strip over the
 * participant grid whenever the call owes the user an explanation: it is
 * `mixed` (a non-enrolled participant is present), in an `interlude` (a
 * confirmed / announced plaintext window), `securing` (a session exists but
 * has not reached a verdict yet), terminally loud, unable to verify its
 * roster, or not encrypted for a DEVICE-level reason. Names the non-enrolled
 * participant(s) with the §0.2 #9 attribution. The ONLY control that resumes
 * publishing as plaintext is "Turn off encryption" → the session's native
 * confirm dialog (T3/T5); an announce (T4) never resumes on its own.
 *
 * The banner is derived ONCE, in `mlsCallModePolicy.callBanner`, on two axes
 * that this component only renders:
 *
 *  - `kind` — Line A, WHAT is wrong (the state clause). Decided under a spec
 *    that asserts no red chip can reach `none`.
 *  - `pause` — Line B, what the user should expect of their OWN media (the
 *    pause clause). `held` means a gate reason is held and NOTHING more: the
 *    2026-09-08 join-race legs proved a held reason is not a quiet wire (a
 *    seat showed this banner while the other seat decrypted its frames for 24
 *    minutes), so every `held` sentence is HEDGED ("should"), never a promise.
 *    `disproved` means the publish gate's sweep FAILED TO PROVE the wire quiet
 *    under a held gate AND a confirming re-sweep actually ran — the policy
 *    folds `callPauseDisproved` and `callPauseDisproofConfirmed` together, so a
 *    budget-exhausted single observation stays `held`. `none` says nothing.
 *
 * 🔴 `disproved` is a ONE-DIRECTIONAL WITHDRAWAL. It cannot raise the banner
 * (visibility is `visible()` ← `isDowngrade()` ← `kind !== "none"`), cannot
 * claim a pause, and cannot turn a green into a red; it only replaces Line B
 * with copy that points at Leave. Its FALSE is what every episode start,
 * every 1→0 transition and every empty gate leave behind, so it never means
 * "proven paused" — which is why there is no `proven` clause to render.
 *
 * On the way DOWN from `disproved` the clause is HELD for
 * `PAUSE_DISPROOF_HOLD_MS` (`pauseClauseHold`), so a sweep that flickers
 * between disproved and not does not flicker the sentence — the same bounce
 * rationale as the re-upgrade hysteresis. The hold drops IMMEDIATELY when the
 * kind goes `none` or the pause goes `none`: a 1→0 resume is real, and "may
 * still be sending" must never sit over a green call.
 *
 * It ALSO carries the two DEVICE-level states, whose cause and remedy are not
 * this call's: this install could encrypt calls but is not set up for the
 * signed-in account, and this shell can never encrypt. They exist because a
 * red NOT-ENCRYPTED chip used to be a dead end there — no banner, no
 * explanation, and (for a device that simply needs setting up) a one-click fix
 * the user was never shown.
 *
 * The two device states are NOT interchangeable, and the copy tracks the
 * difference rather than the label: a never-enrolled device never attempted
 * anything, so nothing is paused and there is nothing to "stay" unencrypted
 * from; a device the server refuses stays E2EE-capable, so its publishing is
 * held by the `negotiating` gate and the release is the only way to be heard.
 * `voice.callCanStayUnencrypted()` is the single term that decides which,
 * instead of a per-arm guess.
 *
 * First paint is debounced by `MIX_BANNER_DEBOUNCE_MS` (judgment call 5) so a
 * cap-refused joiner's brief in/out never flashes the banner — the fail-closed
 * publish pause is immediate and undebounced regardless. `securing` rides
 * through the same debounce: a join that settles inside 3 s shows nothing.
