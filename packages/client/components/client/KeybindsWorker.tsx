/**
 * Turns a keypress into a keybind action, over both transports.
 *
 * Mounted once, in `src/Interface.tsx`, inside `<VoiceContext>` and in the
 * main window only (the popout is turned away by that component's
 * `IS_POPOUT_WINDOW` redirect), following `NotificationsWorker`: a component
 * that grabs `useVoice()` at mount and registers native listeners in
 * `onMount`. Renders nothing.
 *
 * # Two transports, deliberately
 *
 * 1. **The native hook** (`keybinds_arm` + `keybind:down`/`keybind:up`) —
 *    Windows desktop shell only. This is the transport that makes a keybind
 *    *global*: it fires while Sloga is not the focused application.
 * 2. **A focused `window` keydown/keyup** — every platform. This is the
 *    **only** transport that can carry an `"in-app"`-tier action (those need
 *    transient user activation, which a hook callback cannot give), and a
 *    **necessary second** transport for `"global"`-tier ones, because the
 *    native hook is measurably blind while this app owns the foreground:
 *    `ptt.rs`'s module header records 20 physical keydowns producing zero
 *    `keyboard_proc` callbacks, cause still unexplained.
 *
 * 🔴 With Sloga focused a `"global"` binding can therefore arrive by BOTH
 * paths for one press. That is accepted rather than prevented here, and
 * absorbed at two levels: this worker's held-set drops the second edge as
 * `"already-down"`, and `Voice.dispatchKeybind()`'s per-action in-flight and
 * `KEYBIND_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` guards drop it again if it gets past that (the
 * held-set cannot see a native down that arrives while the DOM copy is still
 * in the same task). Stated rather than left to chance: a future change that
 * removed either guard would turn every focused press into two toggles, and
 * the second toggle would undo the first.
 *
 * # 🔴 No precondition is re-checked here
 *
 * `Voice.dispatchKeybind()` applies all five guards through
 * `@revolt/rtc/keybindDispatchPolicy`. Duplicating any of them in this file
 * would drift, and the drift would be invisible because both copies would
 * look right in isolation. This component decides only which edges are real;
 * the policy decides which may run.
 *
 * # Every DECISION is in `@revolt/keybinds/keybindWorkerPolicy`
 *
 * This file is a `.tsx` that reaches `@revolt/rtc`, so no unit runner can
 * load it — `node --test` refuses JSX outright and `@revolt/rtc` pulls
 * `livekit-client/e2ee-worker?worker`. What is left here is the mutable state
 * (`heldSet`, `armGen`), the signal reads, and the side effects.
