              row owes this warning on every render — including one with no
              capture anywhere in its past. A capture-driven note would flash
              once and vanish on reload.

              A <Show>, not a <Match> in either <Switch> above: it is not
              exclusive with the arm status or with the conflict verdict, and
              composes independently of both.

              🔴 There are TWO refusal sources on this row and they do NOT get
              the same treatment, because only one of them means "nothing was
              saved".

              (1) status() "unsupported" / "refused" — the NATIVE layer would
              not register the chord. The chord IS still in the store, and the
              DOM transport has no editable-target filter by design (adding one
              would make it disagree with the native transport, which has no
              DOM to consult), so this chord still fires from a focused
              composer. The warning is true on exactly those rows, and its
              closing "It is saved" is true too. Deliberately NOT suppressed:
              suppressing it there would be the bug, not the fix.

              (2) conflict() a HARD verdict — `reserved` or `push-to-talk`, per
              isHardConflict. Here the capture wrote NOTHING, so binding() is
              still the PREVIOUS chord and this note is describing that older
              chord while the red note above describes the key just pressed.
              Both sentences are individually true, but side by side the user
              who pressed Space and was refused reads "It is saved" as being
              about Space. So the note is suppressed while a hard verdict is
              live — the ONE case where "nothing was saved" is simultaneously on
              screen. The suppression is NOT self-retracting: `conflict` is a
              component-scope signal that only the next capture, a clear, or
              unmount resets, so a hard verdict hides this note until one of
              those happens. That is safe for a different reason — the red
              hard-refusal note above is driven by the same signal and is
              therefore always co-resident with the suppression, so the user
              never sees a silently missing warning, only a suppressed one
              with its explanation beside it.

              A soft `in-app` verdict is NOT suppressed: that chord really was
              saved, so the two notes agree and belong together.

              Soft styling with no ColouredText, matching the `in-app` note
              rather than the red `Unbindable` ones: the binding IS saved, and
              red would read as a refusal. */}
