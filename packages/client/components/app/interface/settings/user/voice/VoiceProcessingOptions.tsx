   * honor: the row passes `conflictMode="code"`, so `KeyCapture` judges the

   * `in-app` verdict means an in-app shortcut shares that key and, while Sloga
   * is focused, pressing it may do both. The chord DID bind, so the row owes a
   * sentence under the keycap saying so.
   *
   * 🔴 Only the soft kind can arrive on this row, so the description renders a
   * single verdict and has no hard-refusal branch. The hard-refusal predicate
   * in `keyCapturePolicy.ts` refuses exactly two kinds, `reserved` and
   * `push-to-talk`, and neither is reachable here in code mode:
   *
   * - `reserved` is judged on the bare code the row will keep, and the panic
   *   combo needs all three modifiers held, so no bare code is ever reserved.
   * - `push-to-talk` is the collision with the caller's `pushToTalkKey`, which
   *   this row passes as `undefined`: it IS the push-to-talk key and cannot
   *   collide with itself.
   *
   * `KeyCapture` owns the verdict and the refusal. A second verdict computed
   * here from the same chord could only ever disagree with it, so this signal
   * stores what the widget reported and nothing more.

                 `conflictMode="code"` because this setting stores and matches
                 `code` alone: `onPushToTalkChange` drops the modifiers and
                 both runtime matchers compare a bare `e.code`. The verdict
                 therefore has to be computed on the bare code the row will
                 actually keep. Judged chord-wise it was wrong in both
                 directions: bare `ArrowDown` drew no notice even though the
                 stored code then opened the mic under `Alt+ArrowDown` (channel
                 navigation) and under every bare arrow press while scrolling
                 chat, while `Alt+ArrowDown` captured deliberately DID warn and
                 stored the identical bare code. */

                    so a bare typing key bound before a reload still draws the
                    note (the same shape as `settings/user/Keybinds.tsx`).

                    🔴 This renders under the default `Space`, and that is
                    honest: `#pttKeydown` has no editable-target guard, so with
                    push to talk on, a space typed into the composer opens the
                    mic. The default is not special-cased.

                    Unlike `Keybinds.tsx`, nothing suppresses it under a
                    conflict: no hard verdict can co-exist here, so there is
                    never a "nothing was saved" sentence for it to contradict.
                    And it does not suggest adding a modifier — this setting
                    DROPS modifiers, so that advice would be false here. */}
