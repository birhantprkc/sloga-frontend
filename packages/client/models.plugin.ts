/**
 * Serves the speech model and the ONNX runtime from OUTSIDE the repository.
 *
 * ## Why not `public/`
 *
 * `public/mediapipe/` is the precedent for self-hosting a model here, and it is
 * 23 MB committed to git. Whisper plus the ONNX runtime is closer to 120 MB,
 * this repository is public, and git history is permanent — that is a
 * disproportionate, irreversible cost for a feature most people will never turn
 * on. So the files live in a directory beside the checkout and are served from
 * there, versioned as deployment assets rather than as source.
 *
 * ## Why they must be same-origin at all
 *
 * transformers.js otherwise fetches models from huggingface.co and
 * onnxruntime-web fetches its `.wasm` runtime from a jsDelivr CDN — two
 * third-party requests made while a private call is in progress, one of which
 * the desktop shell's CSP blocks outright. See `transcriptionEngine.ts`.
 *
 * ## Dev and preview both
 *
 * `vite preview` is how the built app is served in production here, so
 * registering only the dev hook would produce a feature that works locally and
 * 404s everywhere else. Both hooks share one handler, and neither requires a
 * change to the edge configuration.
