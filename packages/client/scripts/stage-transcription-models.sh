# The web does not need this: there, `/models/` is served from outside the
# repository by `models.plugin.ts` (dev and preview both). The shells have no
# such server — they load a bundled copy of `dist` off disk — so without this
# step `/models/` is empty in the app, the Transcribe button appears, and it
# fails the moment somebody presses it.
#
# 🔴 The target is the SHELL'S COPY, never `packages/client/dist` itself.
# That directory is what production serves (vite preview on :5174) and what the
# deploy swaps; putting 64MB inside it would bloat every dist swap and every
# rollback copy for no benefit, since the web already serves these from
# elsewhere. Desktop: stage into `acutest-desktop/frontend-dist`. Android:
# stage into `android/app/src/main/assets/public` AFTER `cap sync`.

# The jsep pair ONLY. This used to copy both pairs on the belief that ORT picks
# its binary from what the webview reports it can do, so a shell on a different
# webview might ask for the other one. That belief is wrong, and it cost 11MB in
# every installer.
#
# The filename is a BUILD-TIME constant, not a runtime choice. onnxruntime-web
# ships several entry points; the plain `onnxruntime-web` specifier that
# @huggingface/transformers imports resolves to the JSEP (WebGPU-capable) build,
# and that build has the name compiled into it — in the shipped bundle it reads
# literally `let s="ort-wasm-simd-threaded.jsep.mjs"`, with no branch in front
# of it. Only `onnxruntime-web/wasm` would name the plain variant, and nothing
# imports that. So `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.{wasm,mjs}` cannot be requested by
# ANY webview, and shipping it is dead weight rather than insurance.
#
# Verified on the deployed bundle, both directions: the jsep name appears in
# `dist/assets/transformers.web-*.js`, and the plain name appears NOWHERE in
# `dist/` at all. Re-run that negative control after any transformers or
# onnxruntime-web version change — the entry-point mapping is theirs, not ours,
# and a 404 for a wasm binary is a confusing thing to debug inside a shell.

# Vite emits a SECOND copy of the same runtime into `assets/`, ~21MB, because
# the ONNX runtime names its own `.wasm` through `new URL(..., import.meta.url)`
# and the bundler follows that. Nothing ever fetches it: the engine sets
# `wasmPaths` to `/models/ort/` before loading anything, and the only reference
# to the bundled copy sits behind ORT's `!wasm.wasmPaths` guard on the proxy-
# worker path, which is doubly dead here because `wasm.proxy` is false.
#
# Proven rather than reasoned. A copy of the built dist with this file deleted
# and `/models/` staged — a shell, in other words — loaded the model, created
# the ORT session and transcribed, and the server's own request log showed the
# runtime fetched from `/models/ort/` and NOT ONE request under `/assets/` for
# a `.wasm`. The server had no SPA fallback, so a stray fetch would have been a
# hard 404 rather than a silently mis-typed index.html.
#
# 🔴 This is safe only while the engine pins `wasmPaths`. If that override is
# ever dropped, ORT falls back to exactly this file and the shells break while
# the web stays fine — so keep the two changes together.
#
# Only the shells' copy is trimmed. `packages/client/dist` keeps its copy: the
# web never downloads it either, and rebuilding the dist to drop it would risk
# the live bundle for disk that no user pays for.
